38KHz = 1 pulse every 26.315us
8Mhz  = 1 instruction every 0.125us
 => 8-bit clock has period of 32us

560us = 17.5 clock cycles

Pin setup (Trippy RGB Wave):

IRin: PB3: 0b00001000

NEC Signal length: 9000 + 4500 + 560*6*16 = 67260us
 => 14 per second

From http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__sfr.html:
cbi and sbi are no longer supported, use:

  sbi(PORTB, PB1); is now PORTB |= _BV(PB1);

  cbi(sfr,bit); is now sfr &= ~(_BV(bit));

Setting Fuse bits
    SUT_CKSEL: FF, DF, C2   - set 8Mhz
